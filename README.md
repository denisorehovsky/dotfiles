## Denis Orehovsky's dotfiles

## Getting Started

There is no script/installer that sets up everything for you. You should clone my dotfiles and go through each section and file and keep only those you find important or useful.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apirobot/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
```
